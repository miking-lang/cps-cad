A miniature of a ship-to-shore crane.

* [fusion-models](fusion-models) contains Fusion 360 models of different versions of the crane.
* [step-models](step-models) contains `.step` files for use in other applications, such as software for 3D-printing.

Bill of materials and a guide on how to control the crane will be added to the [cps-software](https://github.com/miking-lang/cps-software)-repo.
